## What is GraphQL?
**GraphQL** is a query language and runtime for building and consuming APIs. It allows the developer to query specifically which information they need.
&nbsp;
GraphQL is an improvement to using REST APIs with multiple endpoints as a GraphQL includes all the necessary data in a single endpoint. By connecting to a GraphQL server, you can make queries in the browser against the data graph. Queries can then be copied into code directly and called as arguments in JavaScript clientside.
