Prettier is a code formatter that works with several languages including CSS, JavaScript, and React. Prettier is opinionated, in that it makes certain stylistic choices for you such as when to make a new line.
&nbsp;
Prettier is one of the most useful tools over the last few years as It allows developers to focus on the logic of their code, and not the spacing. There is even an option to use Prettier whenever you save VS Code!

## Prettier Install

Add Prettier to your project with the command

```bash
npm install --save-dev prettier
```

Alternatively, you can install Prettier globally with
```bash
npm install --global prettier
```
## Format Script
Once prettier is installed, format text by adding a `format` script to the `package.json` file

2.    "format": "prettier --write \"**/*.+(js|json)\""

This `format` command will adjust your code whenever it is stylistically different than prettier's base rules. Since prettier is only moving around the position of your code, it is not at risk of breaking it.

## Prettier Config File
Prettier comes with basic configuration, which you can add by creating a `.prettierrc` file in the root of your project. There are about 15-20 properties which you can set including `tabWidth`, `semi`, `singleQuote`, etc. For example here is a basic prettier config,

```json
{
  "trailingComma": "all",
  "tabWidth": 2,
  "semi": false,
  "singleQuote": true
}
```

For a full list of config options, check out the [Prettier Playground](https://prettier.io/playground/). The playground allows you to select, preview, and copy the JSON object with your settings.
&nbsp;  
> You can alternatively include your configuration in the`package.json` file under a "prettier" key

## Prettier VSCode Extension
This extension is the real heavyweight in the room when it comes to usefulness. Install the **Prettier - Code Formatter** extension by [Esben Petersen](https://github.com/esbenp). Once it is installed, open your JSON settings ad add 
```json
{
  "editor.defaultFormatter": "esbenp.prettier-vscode",
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
}
```
> Access the JSON Settings by opening the command palette (Ctrl + Shift + p for Windows, cmd + shift + p for Mac). Then type in **settings** and select `Open Settings (JSON)`.

This will set prettier as your default formatter, and **automatically** format your code on save!

## Ignoring Paths
You can tell prettier to ignore certain files and folders adding a `.prettierignore` file to the root of your project. This works exactly the same as `.gitignore`, ignoring the paths specified line by line.  
&nbsp;  
Alternatively you can add an `--ignore-path .gitignore` flag to the command so prettier ignores the paths in your `.gitignore` file.
## Configure with ESLint
Prettier's rules can sometimes conflict with ESLint. If you are also using ESLint in your application, install the `eslint-config-prettier` package, and add it to the **end** of the *extends* array in your `.eslintrc`.
