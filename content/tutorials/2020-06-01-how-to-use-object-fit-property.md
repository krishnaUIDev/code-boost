Images used in HTML or JSX will be loaded by default at their actual size and aspect
ratio. Oftentimes we need to fit images into a specific sized container while maintaining
that aspect ratio. For the longest time the `background` property (instead of `<img />`
tags) was the primary way to do this.  
&nbsp;  
With `object-fit`, we can make our images responsive and crop how we want them. This
property works on media elements such as **images** and **videos**.

## Object-fit

The `object-fit` property is assigned to any media element with specified dimensions. It
works similarly to the `background` CSS property which you can learn more about
[here](https://www.code-boost.com/background-images/). Once the **height** and **width**
are specified, `object-fit` accepts 5 possible values

| Object-fit Value | What it does                                         |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| **contain**      | fits entire image into the element                   |
| **cover**        | fills element generally cropping the image           |
| **fill**         | fills entire element, generally stretching the image |
| **none**         | doesn't resize the image                             |
| **scale-down**   | smaller option of none and contain                   |

The first two options tend to cover a majority of the use cases for object-fit.

## Object-position

This property is similar to the `background-position` property for background images. If
your image doesn't fit perfectly in the contain, this property will allow you to specify
how to align it.  
&nbsp;  
Object-position accepts two arguments, horizontal alignment and vertical alignment.
Percentages (0%, 50%, 100%) or keywords (top, center, bottom, etc) can be used to specify
the position. By default, this property is set to `50%, 50%` which is equivalent to
`center, center`. The top-left of an element is equivalent to `0% 0%` or `top left` while
the bottom-right is `100% 100%` or `bottom right`.

## Examples

For comparison in each example, the original image with **no properties** will be at the
top. The second image will fit inside a **400px by 400px** container beneath it.

### Contain (entire image)

### Cover (fills container)

### Fill (stretch fills container)

### None (original size)

### Scale-down (contain < none)

## Full-width media

Another good use case would be if we wanted our image to fill the full width of the
screen, without changing aspect ratio. We can also center the image at the bottom to show
more of the road with object-position. In this case we could do something like

```css
.image-to-fit {
  width: 100%;
  height: 400px;
  object-fit: cover;
  object-position: 50% 100%;
}
```

### Conclusion

Object fit is a useful tool for quickly cropping images and videos without using the
background property or a custom solution. Since there is practically never a good case for
stretching images, this property is often helpful for maintaining aspect ratios.
