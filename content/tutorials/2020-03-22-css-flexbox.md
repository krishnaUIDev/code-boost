### What is Flexbox

**Flexbox** is a CSS layout module for creating containers that effectively align their content. It is a commonplace and useful syntax for setting up page layouts. 

## Items and Containers

Flexbox properties can be used on either **item** (child) or **container** (parent) elements. Properties for the **container** determine the overall *direction*, *vertical*, and *horizontal* alignment of each item it contains. **Item** properties allow for alignment changes to *individual* elements in the container. 

&nbsp;

Here are the properties for both Items and Containers

| Container Properties | Item Properties |
| -------------------- | --------------- |
| **display: flex**    |                 |
| flex-direction       | order           |
| flex-wrap            | flex-grow       |
| justify-content      | flex-shrink     |
| align-items          | flex-basis      |
| align-content        | align-self      |

>  **Note:** For some of these properties there are numerous other possible values. For the sake of brevity, I will only be mentioning the most common ones.

## Container Properties

In order to create a flexbox, apply `display: flex` to the desired parent container. This will line each child item up in a row.

### Flex-direction

*row* | *row-reverse* | *column* | *column-reverse*  

&nbsp;

By default, this property is set to `row`, meaning your items will be aligned horizontally and in order. Changing this property to `column` will adjust the direction of your items to be aligned vertically instead. It is helpful to think of a flexbox like an **axis**, `row` being along an `x-axis`, and `column` along a `y-axis`.

![flex direction](/img/flex-example2.jpg)

If you wish to reverse the order of the items in your flexbox, this can be achieved with `row-reverse` or `column-reverse`. This can be useful for adjusting the order of navigation links on certain screen sizes.

### Flex-wrap

*no-wrap* | *wrap* | *wrap-reverse*

&nbsp;  

The default value here is `no-wrap`, meaning that the items in a flexbox will overflow out of the container instead of wrapping on to the next line. The value `wrap` will move items onto a new line instead. If you wish to reverse your items, `wrap-reverse` does the same thing as wrap, reversing the item order.

### Justify-content

*flex-start* | *flex-end* | *center* | *space-between* | *space-around* | *space-evenly*  

&nbsp;

This property is the *strawberry jam* of flexbox. Oftentimes there will be extra space left over in your container. This is the property you set to distribute that space. 

&nbsp;

The values `flex-start` and `flex-end` will place your flexed items at the beginning or end of your container accordingly. If you want to center your content, `center` is the clear choice here. Using the values `space-between`, `space-around`, and `space-evenly` will distribute that extra space in often useful ways. `space-between` will place the first item at the start and the last item at the end, with equal space in between items. `space-around` will distribute the extra space equally to the left and right sides of each item (appearing as twice the space on inner elements). Finally, `space-evenly` will divide the remaining space "evenly" applied to every gap between and around items.

### Align-items

*flex-start* | *flex-end* | *center* | *stretch* | *baseline*  

&nbsp;

This property is the toast to **justify-content's** jam. Though named differently, these two properties go hand-in-hand. While justify-content aligns your items along the axis of a flexbox, `align-items` works  **across** that axis. 

In a row flexbox, this property will align your items vertically in a container. In a column flexbox, it will align them horizontally.

The first three values `flex-start`, `flex-end`, and `center` behave the same as for justify-content, except **across** the flexbox axis rather than along.

The value `stretch`, will set the height of every item in a row flexbox to be 100% of the container's height. In a column flexbox, it will instead adjust the widths of these items.

Finally, the value `baseline` will behave similarly to center, except when flexed items contain text. In this case, it will use the bottom of the text rather than the centerline of the item. This is useful when you have text elements with varying heights/sizes.

### Align-content

*flex-start* | *flex-end* | *center* | *space-between* | *space-around* | *space-evenly*

&nbsp;  

This property behaves similar to justify-content except along the **cross** axis. `align-content` is only useful if `flex-wrap: wrap` is on and there are multiple lines to distribute space among.

## Item Properties

A lot can be done in flexbox using **container** properties alone, especially if each item is styled the same. **Item** properties are useful for sizing and positioning individual items within a flexbox.

### Order

*number*


&nbsp;  

This property is similar to `z-index` for html elements on a page. By default, flexed items will be displayed in standard order.  Each element in a flexbox has a default of `order: 0`. Items will be placed in the flexbox from **least to greatest** order. Negative order items will be moved towards the beginning and positive towards the end.

&nbsp;

This property is useful if you wish to adjust the order of your elements on specific screen sizes. In the following example, we can apply a different `order` value for each color class. 

```css
.green { order: 1; }
.red { order: 2; }
.blue { order: 3; }
.yellow { order: 4; }
```

### Flex-grow

*number*  

&nbsp;

This property determines how additional space will be distributed to items when the window gets larger. By default each item has `flex-grow: 1` assigned. If a flexbox assigns additional size to items in its container, it will be according to each of the flex-grow proportions.

&nbsp;

In the following example, I added `flex-grow` properties to the `green` and `yellow` color classes. 

```css
.green { flex-grow: 1; }
.yellow { flex-grow: 2; }
```

![flex grow](/img/flex-example8.jpg)

### Flex-shrink

*number*

&nbsp;

This property behaves similarly to `flex-grow` however it dictates how space will be removed from items when the window shrinks. Each element in a flexbox defaults to `flex-shrink: 1`

&nbsp;

In the following example, I have bumped up the box width so that all boxes will be smaller than their assigned size in order to fit on the line. I also added `flex-shrink` to each element.

```css
.green { flex-shrink: 1; }
.yellow { flex-shrink: 2; }
.blue { flex-shrink: 3; }
.red { flex-shrink: 4; }
```

![flex shrink](/img/flex-example9.jpg)

As you can see, the red element had the highest `flex-shrink` value, and it is the smallest element. This property will shrink each element according to how much additional space it would need for every item to be full-sized in the container.

### Flex-basis

*length*

&nbsp;

This property determines what size a flexed item should be before the remaining space is distributed. It takes in a length value such as pixels, %, rems, etc. By default flexed items have the value `auto` for this property. This means that each item's basis will be that items default size. By increasing or decreasing this value, you can set the intended size of items in your flexbox.

&nbsp;

In the following example, I have set each of the elements to have a different percentage values for `flex-basis`. 

```css
.green { flex-basis: 10%; }
.yellow { flex-basis: 20%; }
.blue { flex-basis: 30%; }
.red { flex-basis: 40%; }
```

![flex basis](/img/flex-example10.jpg)

### Align-self

*auto* | *flex-start* | *flex-end* | *center* | *baseline* | *stretch*;

&nbsp;

Think of this property as the same `align-items` for indivdual items in a flexbox. This property defaults to auto, taking up whatever command is applied in `align-items`.

&nbsp;

This property is useful if you wish to align certain items differently than the rest. Adding this property to a flexed item will override the value applied by align-items.

&nbsp;

In the following example, I added `align-self` to the first 3 items.

```css
.green { align-self: flex-start; }
.yellow { align-self: center; }
.blue { align-self: flex-end; }
```

### Overview

Flexbox is by far one of the most handy tools in the CSS arsenal. If you haven't already been using flexbox in your projects, I highly recommend testing it out and practicing what you've learned. Having the ability to quickly align a large number of items exactly how you would like makes for extremely effecient layout implementation.

### Bonus: Centering Items

With so many elements and nuances in web development, I often find myself searching stack overflow for how to center something. If you ever find yourself stuck trying to do the same, simply apply this set of properties to your parent item

```css
.container {
  display: flex;
  justify-content: center;
  align-items: center;
}
```

Even with 1 item (or only text) in your container, flexbox will position things exactly where you want them ;)
