## What is Netlify CMS?

Netlify CMS is an open source **content-management** tool that works using git. It allows
the user to create posts and pages in a web-based UI. One or more users can sign in to an
**admin** panel to edit, preview, and publish content.

![Netlify CMS](/img/netlify_cms_website.jpg)

Netlify CMS can be used with static site generators such as:

- [Gatsby](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/)
- [Next](https://nextjs.org/)
- [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/)
- [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/)
- [Eleventy](https://www.11ty.dev/)
- [Gridsome](https://gridsome.org/)
- [VuePress](https://vuepress.vuejs.org/)

and more.  
&nbsp;  
Netlify CMS works the same way with each of these sites and there are a ton of
starters already available online. Alternatively, you can quickly add the CMS in to your
existing project with just a few config files.  
&nbsp;  
In terms of customizability, you get full access to the _collections_ and _fields_ of your
data and also over _editing_ the UI. Since the interface is just a React component, you
can even build your own widgets and previews.

## Gatsby Project Setup

To setup the project, first make sure you have [Node JS](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
installed.  
&nbsp;  
We will be using the
[Netlify CMS Template Starter](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/start-with-a-template/) for
Gatsby. Visit the link and select the Netlify deploy button for Gatsby. This will login
you in to Netlify and ask your for a repo name

![Netlify CMS Template](/img/netlify_cms_template_creation.jpg)

When you click **Save & Deploy**, the site will be deployed to Netlify's static hosting
platform. Netlify will also setup a copy of the starter repo on your Github account.

![Netlify dashboard](/img/netlify_dashboard.jpg)

Once the page is built, find and clone the repo of your new blog starter on github

```bash
git clone <git-repo-address>
```

Next navigate into the repo folder, install, and start the project locally with

```bash
cd project-name
npm install
gatsby develop
```

Once the starter builds, visit `http://localhost:8000/` in the browser to start the
project

![Netlify CMS Demo](/img/netlify_cms_starter_coffee.jpg)

Each page on this site includes content that was added using _collections_ in the CMS
configuration file. The blog posts are written in _Markdown_ and then transformed into
pages using _templates_ in Gatsby. In order to login and start editing, we will first need
to setup a login method.

## CMS Backend Options

Only users with authentication should be allowed to edit content in the CMS. We also don't
want to give repo access to just anyone. The currently available backend types are

- Netlify's _Git Gateway_
- Github
- Gitlab
- Bitbucket

### Git Gateway

Git Gateway is the default option for this starter and it requires that you use Netlify's
_Identity_ service for each of your CMS users. This setup allows users to login to the CMS
using their Netlify accounts. Git gateway is a simple a straightforward setup that allows
users to create amd edit content right away.  
&nbsp;   
In this tutorial we will instead be using **Github** for our backend which allows for the
editorial workflow feature. You can find out more about Git Gateway in the
[Netlify docs](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/git-gateway/).

> If you would prefer to use Git Gateway instead of Github, visit `/admin` at either the
> hosted or local application to login with Netlify and skip the next section.

## Github Setup (Editorial Workflow)

We will now connect our application to github for authentication using OAuth. The first
step is to turn off Netlify Identity in the Netlify dashboard under **Your Netlify
site** >> **Settings** >> **Identity**. Scroll to the bottom and click `Delete instance`
under _Delete Identity Instance_.
![Netlify Delete Identity](/img/netlify_delete_identity.jpg)  
Once you've confirmed deleting Netlify Identity, head over to **Github** to generate an
oAuth token. Here, navigate to **Settings** >> **Developer settings** >> **OAuth Apps**
and click `New OAuth App`. ![Netlify Github OAuth](/img/netlify_github_oauth_register.jpg)  
On this page, name the application whatever you like and include the URL Netlify generated
where ts says Homepage URL. We will also need to add a _Authorization callback URL_. Set
this field to be `https://api.netlify.com/auth/done` which can be also found in
[Netlify's OAuth docs](https://docs.netlify.com/visitor-access/oauth-provider-tokens/#setup-and-settings).  
&nbsp;   
When you register the application on github you will be provided with a **Client ID** and
**Client Secret**.

> **Note**: Make sure to keep these keys secure as they will provide access to your repo.

Head back to the Netlify Dashboard under **Your Netlify site** >> **Settings** >> **Access
Control** and click `Install Provider` under the OAuth section.

![Netlify Oauth setup](/img/netlify_oauth.jpg)

Add the ID and secret to the form to configure your Netlify settings for OAuth. &nbsp;
Lastly, we need to configure our code to reflect these changes. In the project folder we
cloned earlier, open the `config.yml` file located in `static/admin/`. This file is our
Netlify CMS _configuration_ and it looks like this

```bash
backend:
  name: git-gateway
  branch: master
  commit_messages:
    create: 'Create {{collection}} “{{slug}}”'
    update: 'Update {{collection}} “{{slug}}”'
    delete: 'Delete {{collection}} “{{slug}}”'
    uploadMedia: '[skip ci] Upload “{{path}}”'
    deleteMedia: '[skip ci] Delete “{{path}}”'

media_folder: static/img
public_folder: /img
```

The above file is written in `.yml` or `YAML` which is a configuration language sensitive
to indenting. In your `config.yml` file, make the following 4 changes:

- Change **name** from `git-gateway` to `github`
- Add **repo** config on the next line with your _github username_ and _repo name_
- Add **open_authoring**: `true` on the next line
- Add **publish_mode**: `editorial workflow`

After making these changes your `config.yml` file should similar to this

```bash
backend:
  name: github
  repo: <github-username>/<github-repo-name>
  open_authoring: true
  branch: master
  commit_messages:
    create: "Create {{collection}} “{{slug}}”"
    update: "Update {{collection}} “{{slug}}”"
    delete: "Delete {{collection}} “{{slug}}”"
    uploadMedia: "[skip ci] Upload “{{path}}”"
    deleteMedia: "[skip ci] Delete “{{path}}”"

publish_mode: editorial_workflow
media_folder: static/img
public_folder: /img
```

Commit your changes to github to complete the Auth setup. Once the build completes, you
will be able to login to your CMS by adding `/admin` at the end of your hosted (or local)
URL.

## Navigating the CMS

Now that we've done the heavy lifting of setting up our project, we've unlocked a bunch of
great features to improve the content creation process for our site. Login to your CMS if
you aren't already, and you should see something like

![Netlify CMS Dashboard](/img/netlify_cms_home.jpg)

### Blog Posting

You'll notice there are 3 blog posts already created. These are all `.md` files that
Netlify CMS generates and Gatsby turns into web pages for us. Whenever you submit edits
for or publish a new post, Netlify CMS will update your git repo so Netlify can build a
new webpage with the provided content. Create a new blog post now with `New Blog` to try
this out

![Netlify New Post](/img/netlify_new_blogpost.jpg)

Changes you make on the left will appear in the preview on the right. Since Netlify CMS is
built in React, you can even style the preview section on the right to be formatted like
your site.

### Collections

This starter gives us access to `Blog` and `Pages` to create. These are both _collections_
in our `config.yml` file from earlier. In this file you can create new collections for
different reusable data types. There are plenty of examples already in this file on how to
add specific fields to a collection.

### Workflow

The _Workflow_ section in the CMS allows users to create drafts, submit content for
review, and queue it up as ready to publish.

![netlify editorial workflow](/img/netlify_cms_editorial.jpg)

Any content that is saved but not published will find it's way here on one of these
boards. Netlify CMS opens a pull request on your repository for each of these files.
Anyone with repo access can approve and publish content from other users.  
&nbsp;    
**Open Authoring** means that anyone with a github account can also submit posts to your
site. This is an excellent feature if you are collaborating with other github users and
the workflow is seamless. Try creating some blog posts now to explore the options here.
Visit your github repo with a post queued up to see the pull request Netlify CMS opened
up.

### Media

The last section here keeps track of our site's media. Netlify CMS stores any images
uploaded here in a folder in your git repo. Any images you add here will get commited the
next time you publish content. This is a great feature as it allows you to keep images
organized without having to type URLs or navigate project folders.

### Conclusion

Netlify CMS is a powerhouse open source tool for blogging and development. There are other
features we didn't include here such as building widgets, connecting to external media
libraries, and customizing previews. I highly recommend checking out Netlify CMS if you
are at all interested in streamlining your site's content creation process without relying
on a paid 3rd party service.
