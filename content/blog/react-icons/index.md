There are plenty of occasions in web development to reach for icons. Of all the packages available (and free), `react-icons` is the best.

## React-icons

React-icons is a combination of 10 icon sets including:
- Font Awesome
- Ionicons
- Material Design
- Typicons
- Github Octicons
- Feather
- Game Icons
- Weather Icons
- Devicons
- Ant Design Icons

The full list of available icons can be found and referenced [here](https://react-icons.netlify.com/#/)

This popular package for React can be installed with the command

```bash
npm install react-icons --save
```

### Import
Each icon in the package can be imported using the individual icon's name imported from the appropriate subfolder

```javascript
// Every icon has the abbreviation for it's set in the name and path
import { FaGithub } from "react-icons/fa";
import { GoZap } from "react-icons/go";
import { TiBeer } from "react-icons/ti";
```

### Usage
These icons can be added to your JSX by simply calling a self-enclosed element with the import name

```jsx
<FaGithub />
<GoZap />
<TiBeer />
```

Each of these custom elements will be replaced by `svg` of the chosen icon.

### Styling
By default, the `size` and `color` of your icons will be the same as your text, unless otherwise specified. These attributes can be modified by changing the `font-size` and `color` properties respectively.

```css
svg {
  font-size: 24px;
  color: orangered;
}
```

If you are using other svgs, it makes more sense to add an icon class and/or id to your icons instead. Icons can be further customized like any other element.

```jsx
<FaGithub className="icon" id="icon-green" />
<GoZap className="icon" id="icon-gold" />
<TiBeer className="icon" />
```
and change your CSS
```css
.icon {
  font-size: 24px;
}
#icon-green {
  color: green;
}
#icon-gold {
  color: gold;
}
```

## Conclusion
React-icons really simplifies the process of acquiring and maintaining icons in a react project. With so many options available for icons, it's a very useful package to install.
