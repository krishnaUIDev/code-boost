Depending on your Browser and Code Editor there are numerous hotkeys and keyboard shortcuts available. If you are using VS Code like the rest of us, here are some of the best tricks to speeding up your coding

### Opening the Editor
Navigate to the project you want to open in your terminal. You can open this project in a new VS Code instance by simply entering

```bash
code .
```

### Shifting Lines (Alt + up/down)
This shortcut allows you to shift a line of code up or down the page without using cut and paste. It is most useful when you have your line written already, and need to adjust its place. 

This shortcut can also be done with numerous adjacent lines by selecting them all first.

### Duplicating Lines (Alt + Shift + up/down)
This shortcut is a powerhouse in VS Code development. First select a line you wish to duplicate, then hold `alt` and `shift`. Now, press `up` or `down` to duplicate this line above or below your current line.

This shortcut can be useful to quickly duplicate a line numerous times before modifying it to something similar.
