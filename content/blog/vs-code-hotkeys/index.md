| Shortcut              | Windows             | Mac                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------- |                     |

| `justify-content`     | **flex-basis**      |                     |
| `align-items`         | **align-self**      |                     |


## Basic Shortcuts

### Opening the Editor
The first shortcut is for opening VS Code in your terminal. Find your project in the terminal and enter

```bash
>> code .
```
### OS Shortcuts

| Shortcut              | Windows             |
| --------------------- | ------------------- |
| Ctrl + C              | Alt + ↑ / ↓         |
| Ctrl + Z              | Shift + Alt + ↓ / ↑ |
| Ctrl + X              | **flex-shrink**     |
| `justify-content`     | **flex-basis**      |
| `align-items`         | **align-self**      |

### Toggle Comments (Command + /)
This shortcut works regardless of programming language, and will comment or uncomment any text in your code editor.

### Shifting Lines (Alt + ↑ / ↓)
This shortcut allows you to shift a line of code up or down the page without using cut and paste. It is most useful when you have your line written already, and need to adjust its place. 

This shortcut can also be done with numerous adjacent lines by selecting them all first.

### Duplicating Lines (Alt + Shift + up/down)
This shortcut is a powerhouse in VS Code development. First select a line you wish to duplicate, then hold `alt` and `shift`. Now, press `up` or `down` to duplicate this line above or below your current line.

### Format Code


## Multiple Cursors
There are a few ways to select multiple cursors in VS Code. When you have more than one cursor selected, your typing will occur in multiple places in the file.

### Create New Cursor
If you want to create a new cursor on windows, use **(Alt + left-click)** or **Cmd + Alt + ↓ / ↑**. You can do the same on Mac with __ or __.  

### Select Multiples
If you have multiple words or strings use **Ctrl + D** on Windows or __ on Mac to select the next instance of a given word or string. You can select all instances of a word in a file by holding this down or instead using **Ctrl + Shift + L** on Windows or __ on Mac.

### Copy/Paste for multiple lines
You can **cut/copy** multiple lines in VS Code. As long as your cursors are still active you can also paste on all cursors.

## Search Shortcuts
VS Code has gotten so much traction as a result of its excellent developer experience. Here are some powerful search features you can use in the editor

### Command Palette
You can access this with **Ctrl + P** on Windows and **Cmd + P** on Mac. This is a search feature that can be used to find and open files. 

### Search all files
